Momentum Investing is a an investment strategy which involves capitalizing on an existing market trend by going long on upward price ticks and going short or to cash when price ticks go down below.

Momentum is observed using the Exponential Moving Average technical indicators, especially the ones aimed at longer days. Usually the combination of 50 Days and 100 Days EMA is used to analyze the current momentum for a stock in the markets. Buy when shorter EMA crosses over longer EMA. Sell on the opposite occurrence.

Let’s look at an example below for Infosys (INFY), the 50 EMA (red) crossed over 100 EMA (green) on December 2017, this crossover was a good indicator of the momentum and we would have one long on INFY.

Treasury yield curves are also another indicator to detect momentum. A 10 year and 2 year yield used in combination, when the 10 year yield curve moves above the 2 year curve, then a ‘BUY’ is signified, ‘SELL’ on the opposite occurrence. Treasury yield curves are strong predictors of recession.
