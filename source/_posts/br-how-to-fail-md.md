A couple of weeks ago, I finished the book ‘How to fail at everything and still win big’ by Scott Adams from start to finish and mind you this book was a breath of fresh air, it was an amazing read and opened my eyes to a different perspective towards things and especially towards failure.

Here’s my attempt to enlist the key points I could comprehend from the book.

* Scott encourages us to mix and match strategies when we are seeking out to achieve something in life.
* He says Passion is bullshit, instead we should focus on keeping our energy levels high. 
* Success instead drives passion.
* He talks about how Markets are in the game of rewarding execution of ideas, not just the ideas themselves.
* He asks us to seek opportunities where we have an advantage.
* Timing is a big component to success, he urges the readers to relentlessly try different things to eventually get them right by luck.
* I love how he says that, its creating systems and following them work better than having goals. By creating systems, he says we should create practical plans and stick to them.
* “If you want success, figure out the price, then pay it.”
* A very important point he raises which could seem controversial to you, he asks us to be selfish and take care of ourselves first, then go about helping others.
* When you choose to maximize personal energy, other priorities get managed by themselves.
* “Find smart friends”
* He says, practice when you can  else rely on experience.
* Every skill you acquire doubles your odd for success.
* Some of the skills that he advocates,
 * Public speaking
 * Psychology
 * Business Writing
 * Accounting
 * Design
 * Persuasion

* He gives a great explanation for how to look at success, the world consists of rare but certain payoffs, he urges us to keep trying as in such an environment, you can fail 99% of the time while knowing success is guaranteed, we just need to stay long in the game.
